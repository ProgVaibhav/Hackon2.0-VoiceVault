# Hackon2.0-VoiceVault
VoiceVault is a desktop based application designed and developed using python programming language. Aim of the tool is to make a cloud storage with proper encryption.  Encryption algorithm is self developed and accurate and secured. Along with Encrypted cloud storage, we are also providing proper user authentication. User authentication is done using Voice Recognition System. 

We developed a voice recognition system using python & machine learning. It won't give acccess to user untill the voice doesn't match. We used 'python_speech_features' & 'pyaudio' modules of python for taking voice samples and for proccessing it, we used GMM model (Gaussian Mixture Model).
